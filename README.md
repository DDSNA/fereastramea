Hi, hello and welcome, Internet sailor! :)

This is a university project to create a GUI in accordance with some guidelines. My theme was an old-school marketplace with several tabs - in Swing (as per requirements). I do not expect you would find much of conventional Java interest here, as this works with older technologies, but be my guest to explore my first forays into this language.

Any feedback is more than welcome!

Yours,
DDSNA
